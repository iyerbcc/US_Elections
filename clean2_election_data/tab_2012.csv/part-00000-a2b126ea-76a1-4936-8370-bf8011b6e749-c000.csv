1 This figure added to or subtracted from the estimate provides the 90-percent confidence interval.,,,
NOTES:,,,
"Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race.  Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible.A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept).",,,
A dash '-' represents zero or rounds to zero.,,,
"The symbol (B) means that the base is less than 75,000 and therefore too small to show the derived measure.",,,
