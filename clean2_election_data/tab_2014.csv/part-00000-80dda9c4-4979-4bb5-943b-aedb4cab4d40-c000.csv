"\"Note: Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race.  Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible.A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reportedAsian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). Unless labeled \"\"non-Hispanic-\"\" the race-alone or race-alone-or-in-combination categories can include individuals of Hispanic-origin\"",,,

"The symbol (B) means that the base is less than 75,000 and therefore too small to show the derived measure.",,,
