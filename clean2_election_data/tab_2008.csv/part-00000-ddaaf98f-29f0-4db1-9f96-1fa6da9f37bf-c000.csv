1This figure added to or subtracted from the estimate provides the 90-percent confidence interval,,,
"NOTE: The symbol (B) means that the base is less than 75,000 and therefore too small to show the derived measure",,,
"\"NOTE: \"\" - \"\" Represents zero or rounds to zero\"",,,
"Note: Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race  Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible  A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept)  This table shows data for people who reported they were the single race White and not Hispanic, people who reported the single race Black, and people who reported the single race Asian  Use of the single-race populations does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data",,,
